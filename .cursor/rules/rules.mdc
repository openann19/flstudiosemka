Core Principles
- Enforce strict TypeScript: Explicit types for all functions and variables.
- Architecture: Use MVC pattern; components in /src/components, services in /src/services.

## Quality Requirements
All code must:
- Pass ESLint (airbnb config) and Prettier.
- Include comprehensive error handling (try-catch with custom errors).
- Be testable: Add JSDoc comments for functions.

## Testing
- Unit: Jest with 80% coverage.
- Integration: Supertest for APIs.
- Mock external services (e.g., AWS with jest.mock).

## React-Specific
- Hooks over classes.
- Accessibility: Semantic elements, keyboard nav, ARIA labels.
- Performance: React.lazy and Suspense for routes.
